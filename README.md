## What I learned

I dove deeper into CSS GRID with this one. Especially in terms of full responsive mobile first workflow. I'm really happy with the way it came out, grid's responsive power when you understand how to use it is amazing. `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(327px, 1fr));` in particular is very powerful. I learned this from [Wes Bos - CSS GRID](https://cssgrid.io/) course, which is free and has amazing content.
